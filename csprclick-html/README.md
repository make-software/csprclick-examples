# CSPR.click HTML Example

This is a really simple example of an HTML app that imports CSPR.click scripts from the CDN. It's used in the guide [Integrating the UI SDK into a non-React application](https://docs.cspr.click/ui-sdk/integrating-the-ui-sdk-into-a-non-react-app)

To test the application, run the following command and open your browser at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

```
npm run serve
```
